# UniDraft: A Universal Plain-Format LaTeX Template for Academic Submission

**UniDraft** is a clean, versatile, and reviewer-friendly LaTeX template designed for preparing "plain format" manuscripts. 
It is optimized for initial submissions to major physics and engineering journals (e.g., *Nature* family, *Physical Review* series, etc.) where a single-column, double-spaced layout with line numbers and separate figures is often required or preferred.


## File Structure

* `UniDraft.cls`: The main class file defining the layout, packages, and custom commands.
* `UniDraft.tex`: The manuscript source file (edit this).
* `bibtex.bib`: (Example) Bibliography file.
